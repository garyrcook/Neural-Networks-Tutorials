# Neural-Networks-Tutorials
A Complete Practical Guide to Creating Neural Networks from the Mathematical Background to the Implementation with Python.

A series of tutorials on neural networks.
The first tutorial contained in ANN-Tutorial.ipynb will introduce some essential mathematics and will explain all the components
involved in creating and training a feedforward artificial neural network from scratch with only Python and NumPy.

Section 0 introduces matrices and some basic calculus in a form that makes understanding neural networks easier.
Section 1 covers activation functions, artificial neurons, feedforward ANNs, the cost function, the batch, stochastic and 
mini-batch versions of the gradient descent algorithm and the backward propagation algorithm.

Throughout the tutorial classes with methods for creating and training neural networks are demonstrated.
The final worked example focuses on SciKit-Learns digits and creates three neural networks and trains each using batch, 
stochastic and mini-batch gradient descent in turn.
In the final example Scikit-Learn is also used for preprocessing the data and comparing the results of the three networks.
